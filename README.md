Welcome! This test covers frontend and backend web development.

First answer the questions on the file **questions.md** and push the commit to a fork of this repo on github, after that you have two hours to finish the challenge.

Good luck!


## Challenge

The challenge is to build a very simple blog with this specifications:

* The blog should have a header and three posts.
* For the layout you have to use flexbox.
* The html should be rendered on the browser, you can use vanilla javascript or a framework. For example [react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), you shouldn't use jquery.
* An api rest for getting the data of the posts.
* For the backend you can use any language/framework that you like. We are currently using nodejs and python in gremyo.
* Use a build system for the frontend, for example [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

**Optional:**

* Deploy the app, you can use something like [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/es/).
* Create an ad below every post using this url from our api [https://r2.gremyo.com/api/v1/sites/eal](https://r2.gremyo.com/api/v1/sites/eal) (we are currently working on the documentantion of our api, if you have any doubt you can ask to our developers).
* Use a css preprocessor.
* Use es2016 standard for javascript code.
* Hability to add comments to each post (you can use something like https://disqus.com/).
* A system for assigning categories to the posts.
